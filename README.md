# Porter - a Vim color scheme

This color scheme for terminal Vim is based on the colors from
the ACME editor and the label of a pitch-black porter.
It features no syntax highlighting and a conservative styling
of window elements. Colors are reused from the terminal
background and foreground.
The following colors are recommended,

   - #ffffdd (background)
   - #000000 (foreground)

The color scheme is somewhat compatible with the Solarized Light
color scheme.

## Installation
Porter supports installation by Pathogen,

    # git clone git://github.com/rkk/porter.git $HOME/.vim/bundle/porter

Add the following line to your Vim configuration file,

    colorscheme porter

Use `:colorscheme <TAB>` to display a list of currently installed
color schemes.
