# Porter - a Vim color scheme

This color scheme for terminal Vim is based on the colors from
the ACME editor and the label of a pitch-black porter.
It features no syntax highlighting and a conservative styling
of window elements. Colors are reused from the terminal
background and foreground.
The following colors are recommended,

   - #ffffdd (background)
   - #000000 (foreground)

The color scheme is somewhat compatible with the Solarized Light
color scheme.
